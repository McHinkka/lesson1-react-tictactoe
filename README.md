# React Tic-Tac-Toe

Facebook has written a very good introduction for the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library. You can find it from [React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

The tutorial can be done either in your own internet browser (1) using the CodeSandbox service or (2) locally on your computer. If you're unfamiliar with any software development, we recommend using CodeSandbox for now.

### (1) In Your Own Browser

1. Open the [React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).
2. "Fork" the [setup sandbox](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#setup-for-the-tutorial)
3. _May the source be with you_

### (2) Run the tutorial locally

#### Prerequisites

* [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
* Any shell, console or terminal. For windows, we recommend [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
* Any code editor. If you are new to programming, we recommend starting with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

1. Clone this repository:

        git clone https://github.com/koodi101/lesson1-react-tictactoe.git

   Alternatively you can fork the repository, i.e. make a clone of it to your GitHub account. Clone that preferably using the `SSH` link.
   > You are going to have to sign up to GitHub if you want to fork the repository. This is required later on the course anyways...

1. Open the cloned folder

1. Start the local development server using Node.js

#### Local development environment using Node.js

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
1. Open your favorite shell.

1. Go to the cloned directory:

        cd lesson1-react-tictactoe

1. Install dependencies:

        npm install

1. Run the app:

        npm start

1. Open browser in [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

#### Using Docker (advanced)

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
1. Open your favorite shell.

1. Go to the cloned directory:

        cd lesson1-react-tictactoe

1. Run the app:

        docker-compose up

1. Open browser in [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
